Transmission rates from women to men and men to women were the same and varied little with the circumcision status of the men, the lifetime sexual experience of uninfected partners, or the oncogenic risk of the HPV type. - See more at: http://www.jwatch.org/jw201201100000001/2012/01/10/estimating-hpv-transmission-rates#sthash.1WBslbRk.dpuf

Among 308 college-age women and their male sexual partners — all in relationships of less than 6 months' duration — researchers identified 179 couples discordant for one or more HPV types. About 6 months later, genital sampling indicated HPV transmission in 73 couples (41%). The transmission rate was 3.7 instances per 100 person-months, for a per-person transmission probability of about 20% during a 6-month period.
